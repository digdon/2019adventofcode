# Day 22: Slam Shuffle
I'd seen rumblings that day 22 was absolutely awful, so I was sort of prepared....

Part 1, of course, was ridiculously easy, even to do it the (obvious) brute force method. And while perusing other solutions on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ee0rqi/2019_day_22_solutions/) (thinking about part 2), I stumbled onto a mechanism that just follows the position of the 2019 card, using some very simple math (brilliant!).

Part 2..... No. No no no no no a thousand times no. I don't come here for this sort of foolishness. Perused reddit, looking for hints. Lots of stuff about Montgomery modular multiplication, group theory, linear polynomials, and Fermat's little theorem and modular inverses. No freaking clue what any of that is. Maybe if I had a math degree this would be interesting, but c'mon. Found [this excellent solution](https://github.com/metalim/adventofcode.2019.python/blob/master/22_cards_shuffle.ipynb) and converted it to Java, with some mods. I hate puzzles like this.
